## 1. Components of the Client Side Component Model (ccm)

Yet another componentization of the Web: The WWW has yet no well established component model which all browser manufacturers would agree upon, see [Web Platform Podcast 54: Are Web Components Ready Yet?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDtpXhMQeew) and [What happened to Web Components?](http://www.2ality.com/2015/08/web-component-status.html). The [Client Side Component Model (ccm)](https://github.com/akless/ccm-components/wiki/Einstieg:-Was-ist-ccm%3F) is yet another componentization of the Web. It is based on a framework developed by Andr√© Kless in his master thesis 2014 at the University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg introducing JavaScript+JSON+CSS-components which may be loaded cross-domain cross-platform via [JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) and rendered into any div or span in any web page. For introductory tutorials see the Wiki Pages in his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/akless/ccm-components).
